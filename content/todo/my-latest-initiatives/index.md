description: "There are many things I want to accomplish in my life, one of them is creating and owning a company that adds values to peoples lives. I constantly struggle to reach that goal, here are some new things I am going to try."

I have personal seasons. Ups and downs that seem to govern how I feel about the day, month, year ahead. Often I am up. I have a plan, I have concrete goals and a path I can walk. Once every 2 or 3 years I hit a down. Not sure how long it actually lasts, I've not taken the time to think about it. Right now I am down. Running around making important decisions with only a lose plan. No backup. What makes that all worse? I am not sure that the decisions I am making are helping me toward one my life goals - to run my own lifestyle business.

Lots of things are happing right now in my life. I have a new baby (3rd and final), I have a new job, I am moving to a new city, climate, country. It is all exciting. They all bring challenges, which I like, but I feel as though they don't have a purpose. (other than my children, they have a clear place in my life ❤️).

I want to run a company, so I make decisions that I think will help me reach that goal, yet I never seem to reach that goal. Am I making the right decisions? Am I working hard enough? Do I have the right ideas? Am I being too cautious? I am going to attempt to answer these questions with some personal initiatives. In hope that I can discover purpose in the nebulous I find myself in.

3 things I want to talk about that I think are the right things to do right now.

1. [Flawk.to](https://flawk.to) and the impact I want it to have
2. My most recent initiatives
